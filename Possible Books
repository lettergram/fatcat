I guess just say which one seems best, I tried to pick ones that don't require too much background knowledge

Data Structures in C by Noel Kalicharan - C++ would be easier, but we all know C (I believe) so it probably wont be too bad

Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Third Edition by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, Jian Pei

Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition by Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank and Mark A. Hall

Expert Trading Systems: Modeling Financial Markets with Kernel Regression by John R. Wolberg

Statistics in Plain English, Third Edition by Timothy C. Urdan - I'm pretty up to date on all my math, but this covers most of the concepts and language barriers

Feel free to add a book or mention if you think a book is horrid. In either case we should cover all the topics above.
If not this project will be pretty hard because we'll have no idea how to set stuff up.
